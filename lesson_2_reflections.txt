What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The metadata for tracking file revision history is added to the directory. This needs to be done to convert a locally saved directory to a repository that can use git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

You cannot edit the staging area directly. It allows us to create temporary copies of what we think is good to push on to the main repository.

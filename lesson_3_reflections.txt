When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever you are working on a colloborative project or if you are working across multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes made by someone else on the remote repository might interfere with what you are working on.
